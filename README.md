**Undergraduate Thesis Project - Development of a Hotel Booking and Reservation System**

This undergraduate thesis project represents the culmination of my academic journey in computer science. The primary focus of this project is the design and implementation of a comprehensive Hotel Booking and Reservation System, which has been developed from the ground up, catering to the specific requirements of the hospitality industry.

**Project Overview:**

- **Objective**: The core objective of this project is to create an efficient and user-friendly Hotel Booking and Reservation System, employing cutting-edge web technologies.

- **MERN Stack Development**: The system is built upon the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, ensuring a robust and scalable foundation.

- **React Frontend**: The user interface is developed using React, with a particular emphasis on creating a seamless and intuitive user experience. React components have been meticulously designed and organized to ensure the system's responsiveness.

- **Node.js Backend**: The backend is powered by Node.js, which serves as the backbone of the system, providing API endpoints for reservations and facilitating secure transactions.

- **MongoDB Database**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is employed to efficiently manage and store reservation data. It offers flexibility and scalability to meet the demands of a dynamic booking system.

- **Context API and JWT**: State management within the application is achieved through the use of React's Context API. User authentication and data security are implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

- **Custom Hooks and React Calendar**: Custom hooks are introduced to enhance code reusability and maintainability. A custom React calendar component has been integrated to enable users to visualize and manage reservation dates seamlessly.

This project is a testament to the knowledge and skills acquired throughout my academic journey. It showcases my proficiency in software development and my ability to tackle complex challenges in web application development.

I am excited to present this thesis as it not only fulfills the academic requirements for my undergraduate degree but also represents the beginning of my journey into the professional world of software development. The Hotel Booking and Reservation System demonstrates my passion for coding and problem-solving, and I am eager to contribute my skills to the industry.

This project has been a labor of love, and I hope it serves as a valuable resource for the hospitality sector while also reflecting my dedication to the field of computer science.
